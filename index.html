    <h3 style="color:red;">Motto</h3>
    <br>The motto of our school is 'Tejasvi navadhitamastu', taken from the 'Taittriya Upanishad" which means, "let our study be enlightening and fruitful". Right knowledge enlightens and empowers. It aims at the total unfolding of the creative potentialities of the students. The people who become aware of their inner riches see their life and the reality around them in a new and bright perspective. When they are put at the service of others, they lighten their burdens too.Thus, knowledge lightens and enlightens.
<p>
Learning illumines both the teacher and the taught. This enlightenment, this new vision fills them with the power to transform their lives and the world. The kind of education that the Little Flower Sec. School is committed to impart is in tune with these ideals of education. Accordingly, knowledge is not a means to make a living, but to make the life meaningful. Let what we learn enlighten us. Tejasvi navadhitamastu
